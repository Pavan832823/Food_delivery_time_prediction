🍔 Food Delivery Time Prediction 🕒
This project uses machine learning to predict the delivery time for online food orders. It aims to optimize delivery logistics and improve customer satisfaction.

📌 Project Objectives
Analyze food delivery data.
Build a predictive model using machine learning.
Estimate delivery time based on various real-world features (e.g., location, traffic, weather).
🧠 Technologies & Libraries Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy – Data Manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data Visualization
Scikit-learn – Model Building (Regression/Classification)
Jupyter Notebook – Development Environment
Pickle – Model Serialization

⚙️ How to Run
Clone or download this repository.
Open the .ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.
Run all the cells to explore EDA, model training, and evaluation.
To reuse the trained model:
import pickle
loaded_model = pickle.load(open(r'path_to_your_model\trained_model.sav', 'rb'))
prediction = loaded_model.predict(new_data)
